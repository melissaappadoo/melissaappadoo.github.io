											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Games are my passion, I see games as the most complete form of art where everything can be expressed and created, and I want to be part of this creation. My biggest drive is my dream to inspire someone the same way games inspired me as a kid. 
											I studied games in college where I learned to use Unity and C#. Now I have graduated from Games Programming at Staffordshire University, where I developed my C++ and Unreal Engine skills. I am also researching and learning about audio programming and psychoacoustics using C++, Wwise and Metasounds.

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<!--Audio Engine - Cross Platform Engine Development-->
										<h3>Audio Engine // C++ // Wwise</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/CPED.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>Here, me and my team had to build a game engine. I was in charge of building the audio engine. I used Wwise, C++ and DirectX. With the engine that was built, developers can change the position of sound in a 3D space, pitch and volume. Helper functions were created to help developers when using the engine, for example a set volume function. The video is a small demonstration of audio working with our game.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Mario-->
										<h3>Mario // C++ // SDL</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/Mario.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>For my Games Engine Creation module, I wrote a 2D game using the C++ programming language and the SDL library. This consisted of one level of the game Mario bros. I used an object-oriented approach to keep the code tidy and made sure it was well commented. I also had to implement various components such as the texture, character and sceen manager.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Ableton Wavetable-->
										<h3>Ableton Wavetable // Unreal</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/wavetable.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>For my Audio Development module, I created an audio synthesizer which uses the wavetable technique and can be controlled using the user interface, like the plugin by Ableton. This allowed me to learn the various aspects of the synthesizer and how to manipulate them with Unreal Engineâ€™s Metasounds.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Guitar Hero-->
										<h3>Guitar Hero // Unreal</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/guitar hero.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>I also created a project that showcased a game mechanic that relies on audio in some measure using Unreal Engine. I decided to create a Guitar Hero style rhythm game where the player can use the computer keyboard to match the notes displayed on the scrolling note highway corresponding to notes played in a song.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Amp Sim-->
										<h3>Amp Simulator // Max/MSP</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/Demonstration Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>For my Final Year Project, I decided to develop an amp simulator and multi-effects rack using Max/MSP. I wanted to explore the considerations of programming a guitar rig that can enable the user to create their own custom effect chains, and quickly adjust the settings to create the sound they want. This project taught me how to deliver audio systems that can be used for other projects.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Low-Level Platform Optimisation-->
										<h3>Low-Level Platform Optimisation // C++</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/Low-Level Platform Optimisation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>This was a project for my university module, where the main objective was to optimise this graphics application. For this I worked with overloading new and delete, walking the heap, multithreading and memory pools. By overloading the operators I was able to track how much memory is left, this helped me to be able to check if there was any new initialisation that is not being deleted. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Bolt Breakers-->
										<h3>Bolt Breakers // Unreal</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/Bolt Breakers.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>This was a group project of mine at university that simulates a studio. As a group our aim was to use an engine in order to create a game. I was in charge of programming the gameplay and audio aspects of the game. For this we used Unreal Engine 5 and C++. I used this system to gain a better understanding of audio systems in engines, as this is my area of interest.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--AI - Behaviours-->
										<h3>AI - Behaviours // Unity // C#</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/AI - Behaviours.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>For this project I had to work on steering behaviours for my Artificial Intelligence. I calculated the forces with the use of physics and vectors. It was built on Unity and C#. Also, pathfinding was programmed to find the better route in the map to the destination. The calculation of the pathfinding works based on the cost of each node on the map. It gets the end position and checks which route is going to take less movement.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<!--Simple EQ-->
										<h3>Simple EQ // C++ // JUCE</h3>
										<video width="320" height="240" controls>
											<source src="videos/Simple EQ.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>As a personal project I decided to improve my audio programming skills by building an audio plugin using C++ and the JUCE framework. This allowed me to learn how to create audio parameters and set up DSP.</p>
